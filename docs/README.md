# Botsing's Documentation Website

This is the source directory of the [Botsing companion website](http://stamp-project.github.io/botsing). It basically contains the documentation. This a static website, which is generated by Jekyll behind the scene.

Here is the structure of the directory:

 * `assets` contains the static resources, such as images, or PDF files that we want to provide access to.

 * `data/` contains a single YAML file that describes the structures of navigation bar, that is what entries exists and the pages they point to.

 * `pages` contains all the pages (except `index.md`). This is simply a convention to avoid a mess at the root level.

 * `_layouts/` contains the HTML template that we have overriden from the chosen them (minimal).

 * `_sass/` contains the CSS template that we have overriden from the chosen them (minimal).


## How run it on your local machine

If you make changes to the site, you can visualize them by serving the
site on your machine. We assume that Ruby and bundler are already
installed.

	$> bundle update
	$> bundle install
	$> bundle exec jekyll serve

The website is now accessible on [your own machine](http://localhost:4000).


## Adding New pages

We've chosen to place new pages in the `pages` directory and link them
to other pages or to the menu by editing the `_data/menu.yml`as
follows:

```yaml
- name: Botsing
  url: index

- name: Getting Started
  url: pages/getting_started
  children:
    - name: Installation
      url: pages/installation

- name: Case Studies
  url:
  children:
    - name: XWiki
      url: pages/xwiki
    - name: CityGo
      url: pages/citygo
    - name: Awesome Case-study     # <-- Here I added a new menu entry
      url: pages/awesome           # No file extension

- name: Other
  url:
  children:
    - name: Publications
      url: pages/publications

```
