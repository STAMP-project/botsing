Botsing is a Java framework for search-based crash reproduction. It implements and extends the EvoCrash approach and relies on [EvoSuite](http://www.evosuite.org) for Java code instrumentation during test generation and execution. The documentation is available on the [Botsing companion website](https://stamp-project.github.io/botsing).
